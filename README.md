# Multi-Disease Detection and Severity Grading in Guava Leaves  
### ULTRA-HD Neural Pathology Analysis using YOLO + Grad-CAM

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for:
- Multi-disease detection in guava leaves
- Pixel-accurate severity estimation (Pathogen Load %)
- Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) detection
- Explainable AI using Grad-CAM (Enhanced XAI mode)

The system is designed for **precision agriculture**, **plant pathology research**, and **decision support systems**.
